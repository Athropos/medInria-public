This module is a simple but yet powerfull medical image browser. No data processing can be
performed from here, for that please refer to the other modules.

From this module you can quickly open several images in a ``web browser style''. It also provide an easy-to-use DICOM
importer and a ``radiologic convention reorientation tool''.

All the DICOM exam volumes are now visible in the preview window. For the user
convinience, a ``save all'' button has been added in order to quickly save all the loaded
images in a given directory. They will be saved in ITK Analyze format (.hdr - .img).

The preview window shows every volume loaded in the Image Viewer. you can quickly access
to one of the images by clicking on the down arrow icon in the upper right corner. it will
pop up a list of the images. 
In the preview window, you can choose to link (default) or unlink the views for the
current chosen interaction (see Sect. \ref{sec:2d3dviewinteractions}). The user can click
in one tabulation to switch to the corresponding image. When one of the image is shown,
you can easily delete it by clicking in its corresponding cross.
